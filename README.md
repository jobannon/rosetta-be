# rosetta-be

## Local Deployment

### Python & Flask Setup

- Install Pyenv with Homebrew
    ```
    brew install pyenv
    ```
- Add pyenv init to your shell profile (see instructions [here under step 3](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout))
    - If using Bash, enter the following in your terminal:
        ```
        echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile
        ```
    - If using Zsh, use the following:
        ```
        echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
        ```
- Restart terminal to allow changes to take effect.
- Install Python 3.7.7 with Pyenv
    ```
    pyenv install 3.7.7
    ```
- Set up virtual environment
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    ```
- Upgrade Pip (or, if not made available by Python 3, [install Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#))
    ```
    pip install -U pip
    ```
- Use Pip to install packages in requirements.txt:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Set environment variables:
    ```
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr/app
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    ```

### Database Setup

- Install PostgreSQL with Homebrew
    ```
    brew install postgresql
    ```
- Create database from terminal
    - Open interactive PostgreSQL session:
        ```
        psql
        ```
    - Enter SQL command to create empty database:
        ```
        CREATE DATABASE rosetta_dev;
        ```
- Run migrations to add tables to database

    ```
    python flaskr/manage.py db upgrade
    ```
    - If you encounter the error "Target database is not up to date," you are likely out of sync with the migrations. Run `python flaskr/manage.py db stamp head` to set the current state of your database as "head," then re-attempt to run `db upgrade`.
    - If you had to drop your DB in development, you might need to run `python flaskr/manage.py db migrate` before `python flaskr/manage.py db upgrade`.

- If you need to populate your database, run the following commands, but if possible, it's preferable to import this from an already populated database, such as the Rosetta production server database (to be added):

NOTE: en_core_web_lg doesn't exist as a package in its own right on pypi.org or Anaconda, so you can't just pip install it by name. Instead, you must run the following command:

`python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`

Afterwards, run the following scripts to populate the database:
 
   ```
   python flaskr/manage.py get_ruby_methods
   python flaskr/manage.py get_js_methods
   python flaskr/relevancy_rating_generator.py
   ```

### Starting Flask

- To run server on `localhost:5000`:
    ```
    flask run
    ```
- To run Flask shell session with access to ORM:
    ```
    python flaskr/manage.py shell
    ```

### Accessing GraphQL Endpoint
(This is intended for current developers and will be edited before final docs are published)
- Locally: `localhost:5000/graphql`
   - This will bring up the GraphiQL interface
   - To get all languages:
   ```
   {
     allLanguages{
       edges{
         node{
           name
           id
           }
         }
       }
     }
  ```
  - To get all methods:
  ```
  {
    allMethods{
      edges{
        node{
          name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ```
  - To get all methods with language node:
  ```
  {
    allMethods{
      edges{
        node{
          name
          snippet
          language {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  - To get the first 5 methods of the 1st language:
  ```
  {
    allLanguages(first:1){
      edges{
        node{
          name
          methods(first:5) {
            edges {
              node {
                name
                description
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
